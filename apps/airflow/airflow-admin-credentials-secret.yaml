stringData:
  # Default keys expected by the Airflow chart for existingUser.passwordSecret
  # are 'username' and 'password', or just 'password' if username is set directly.
  # For the 'users.passwordSecretRef' (newer charts) it's often 'user-password'
  # Let's use keys that are commonly supported for user creation.
  # The official chart's 'users' block expects 'user-username' and 'user-password'
  # if using 'users[].passwordSecretRef'.
  # If using the older 'fernetKey' and 'webserverSecretKey' approach, user creation is often
  # handled by a job that might look for different env vars or secret keys.
  # However, for the 'users' array in values.yaml:
  username: "admin" # Or your desired admin username
  password: "Lazarus17" # Replace with a strong password
